# stockmarket-helper
It's a project based on the Alpha Vantage financial API. My purpose with this project is to filter out the most important aspects of a stock and the company in its background.

To use the program, you first need to register on <https://www.alphavantage.co/> and get your API key.
Then you can use the stonks.exe or run the python scripts on their own. Note that, for the latter one, you need to have the pandas, PyQt5, beautifulsoup4, numpy and requests packages installed.
